  "description": "This plugin adds a new format that allows you to create Minecraft-styled title models that you can render in high quality.\n\n<h2>Getting started</h2><p>To use this plugin, start by creating a new <strong>Minecraft Title</strong> project from the start screen, or go to <strong>File &gt; New &gt; Minecraft Title</strong>. You can then use the pop-up dialog to add some text to the project. Don't forget to set the text type! You can add more text by using the <strong>Add Text</strong> button in the outliner.\n\nOnce you are done configuring your text, you can go to the <strong>Render</strong> tab at the top right to produce a high-quality render of your title. The <strong>Position Camera</strong> button will set the camera angle for you.</p>",
