  "description": "Overgrowth is a 32x32 resource pack that changes Minecraft in so many different ways but manages to keep things new and fresh but also keeps things rather familiar to vanilla Minecraft. The pack has numerous features such as 3d models for both blocks & mobs that I'm sure you will like alot! Also it looks great with shaders!",
  "optifine": "OptiFine is used for custom entity models, connected textures, custom item textures, random entity textures, and more.",
