ADDING TRANSPARENCY TO SOLID BLOCKS CAN CAUSE XRAY DEPENDING ON HOW YOU USE IT!\n\nBy default, solid blocks do not support transparent textures, resulting in them rendering like the first image.\n\nThis pack makes it so that you can use transparent textures with them, meaning they instead can render like the second image.",
