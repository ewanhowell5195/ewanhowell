  "description": "Mickey Joe's \"Barely Default\" is a pack Mickey Joe made initially just for personal use. At one point he made a Reddit post with a screenshot of what he had made. The post got a surprising amount of satisfying feedback so Mickey decided to try to turn his work into an actual pack. Which you can play with! or don't. I can't tell you what to do",
  "optifine": "OptiFine will give you a better BarelyDefault experience with custom vanity armour sets, unique tools and weapons, amazing entity models, connected textures, slick animations in places you never images, and all the nitpicky tweaks you could hope for.",
