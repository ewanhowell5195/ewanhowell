  "description": "Caelesti is an advanced vanilla+ pack which takes advantage of many hidden features that are both vanilla, and OptiFine reliant to completely change the way that Minecraft is experienced. The pack has a huge focus on custom flora, and fauna, and attempts to improve the many inconsistencies and flaws of the original look of Minecraft.",
  "optifine": "OptiFine's connected textures are used to add snow onto the tops of blocks which wouldn't usually allow seperate top block only textures.",
