  "description": "Portal 2 is a puzzle game released by Valve in 2011, and is widely regarded as the best game of all time.\n\nThis map is the Minecraft \"port\"/recreation of this humorous space-age game, bringing all of the functionality from Portal 2 to Minecraft without any mods.\n\nThe map is a short, entirely vanilla experience of Chapter 1, aiming to invoke nostalgia and add to the Portal 2 experience.",
